[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/perminder-klair/kickoff-koa2.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

> An opinionated boilerplate for koa v2 with batteries included.

#### Requirements
```bash
- Node >=v7.7.2
- NPM >=v4.1.2
- MongoDB
```
#### Features
```bash
- Local Authentication using Email and Password (Login, Register)
- Contact form request (powered by Mailgun, Sendgrid or Mandrill)
- File upload using Amazon S3
- Authorised routes using JWT tokens (Get current logged in data, profile update, password reset)
- GraphQL loaded (Apollo Data)
```
### Setup
```bash
  # clone the repository
  λ git clone https://github.com/perminder-klair/kickoff-koa2
  # change the current directory
  λ cd kickoff-koa2
  # install all dependencies
  λ yarn install
  # run the project
  λ yarn start
```

### Structure
```bash
├── README.md           # you're here
├── bin                 # folder that bootstraps the application
├── src                 # contains source files
│   ├── conf            # wraps configurations files
│   ├── controller      # contains all controllers in the application
│   ├── graphql         # contains graphql schema and resolvers
│   ├── middleware      # folder with all middlewares
│   ├── route           # wraps all the routes and exports a single composed middleware
│   └── service         # contains all the service logic
│   └── utils           # contains all extra utilities
└── test                # unit tests
```

**Suggestion:** Every folder name is _singular_ like `route`, `middleware` instead of `routes`, `middlewares`. If you want to add more folders as per your need, make sure they should be singular too (for e.g. `util`, `helper` etc) only for the sake of consistency.
